# Putnam-like problems in Lean

This repository contains Lean formalizations of Putnam-like problems. This
repository is maintained by Eric Wieser and Henryk Michalewski.

Putnam-like is a benchmark crafted to probe the boundaries of mathematical
reasoning in sophisticated AI systems. This collection offers university-level
mathematical challenges, echoing the spirit of the Putnam Competition and
similar student contests. These problems are intended to assess the depths of
mathematical understanding, moving beyond superficial mathematical mimicry to
demand a more profound and adaptable form of abstract thinking.

contains natural language problem statements, grading rubrics, a more detailed
README, and information about the math and Lean experts who contributed to this
dataset.
