Does there exist a sequence $(z_n) \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ such that
$$
\frac{n}{\pi} \int_{B(z_n, 1/n)} \varphi(x) \, dx \to 0
$$
for every continuous function $\varphi : \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and
$B(z_n, 1/n) \cap B(z_m, 1/m) = \emptyset$ for $n \neq m$, where $B(x_0, r)$ denotes the open ball
in $\mathbb{R}^2$, centered at $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^2$ of radius $r$?
