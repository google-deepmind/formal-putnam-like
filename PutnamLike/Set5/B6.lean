-- Note: the property is not enough to fully specify `F` - is something missing from the informal statement?

Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the family of subsets of $S=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ such that
\[
A\in\mathcal{F}, B\subset A \Rightarrow B\in\mathcal{F}.
\]
Prove that the function $f:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ defined by
\[
f(t):=\sum_{A\in\mathcal{F}} t^{|A|}(1-t)^{|S\setminus A|}
\]
is non-increasing.
