Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and suppose that $r_i \in (0,1)$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$. For every sequence of indices $1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < \ldots < i_k \leq n$ we define
$$
m_{i_1, \ldots, i_k} := \min \{ r_{i_1}, r_{i_2}, \ldots, r_{i_k} \}.
$$
Show that for every $N \in \mathbb{N}$ the following inequality holds
\begin{align*}
\sum_{k=1}^n \sum_{1 \leq i_1 < \ldots < i_k \leq n} (-1)^{k} \frac{m_{i_1, \ldots, i_k}^{2N+i_1+\ldots+i_k-1}}{i_1 + \ldots + i_k + N} \leq 0.
\end{align*}
